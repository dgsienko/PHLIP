# README
This is the repository for the CS 411 (Group 4) project, P.H.L.I.P.

## Overview
Philips Hue Light Interface Program, or P.H.L.I.P., aims to help you do more with Philip Hue lights. We currently have two modes: Weather Alerts and Audio Visualizer.

### Weather Alerts
A user sets up an account with his location and can then set up a bunch of weather-based rules. For example, "turn the lights yellow for a minute at sunrise," or "flash the lights red for 30 seconds when the temperature goes above 90Â°F."

### Audio Visualizer
