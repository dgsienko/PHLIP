4. Justification of platform/architecture

- Thin Client
Our project should still be running and updating the lights even if the webpage isn’t open. The webpage only serves as a portal (and audio player) to control the lighting, but because the lights need updating on a hardware level, it makes sense to do all the computation on the backend.

-Flask/Python
Out of our options (JSP, Node, PHP, Flask, etc…) we thought that Flask would be the easiest platform for our group since we all just learned it for another class.

-MySQL
Several of our group members are comfortable with relational DBs, so a SQL database is a solid choice.
